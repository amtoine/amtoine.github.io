In february 2024, i've started playing [Mario Kart 8 Deluxe] online: it's fun to
run against bots and complete the full solo _campaign_ but it's even more fun to
compete against real humans, stronger and stronger as you become better yourself.

As a kind _scientific experiment, i've started recording my points after each
race.
In fact, i was just curious to see what the shape of the resulting curve would
look like over time :yum:
